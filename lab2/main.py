# Given n (n >= 3) distinct elements, design two algorithms to compute the first three smallest
# elements using an incremental and a divide-and-conquer approach, respectively. Both your
# algorithms should return a triple (x,y,z) such that x<y<z<(the rest n3input
# elements)and run in linear time in the worst case. Show that your algorithms are correct
# and calculate the exact number of comparisons used by the algorithms. You may assume
# that n=3Ã—2k31 for some positive integer k. Hint: One can use the induction technique
# to show the correctness. Check Chapter 4 for more examples of performance analyses.
